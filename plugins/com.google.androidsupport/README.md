# Android Support for Cordova

This is a simple Cordova plugin that adds the Android Support v4 client library to your app.

No user interaction is required; it should be automatically detected and included by Eclipse.

## Developer Guide

If you're an app developer, there's nothing to see here.  This is not a useful plugin on its own. There is no Cordova API for Android Support.

Instead, this plugin should be used by plugin authors as a dependency if their plugin's Android native code requires Android Support.
